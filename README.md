# ClubEvent


The ClubEvent is a website made using java spring as a backend tool, J2EE concepts, Jsp, CSS, HTML. The website is fully responsive and is made taking care of UI/UX designs.
The idea behind the website is to create a platform for students who are keen to participate in college events. we aim to integrate all the colleges and universities so that each university/college can add their respective events, clubs, and competitions so whoever wants to participate can easily register for the events available.
